Any .cshtml templates you produce here need to be "Copied To Output".

If you're not familiar with this, it means that your resource file (the template, in this case) is
copied to the .bin folder, so it sits alongside the .dlls that are produced as part of the output.

When you program is executed, this resource is then available.

To copy to output, right-click the .cshtml file to bring up the properties ... and choose "copy always".
